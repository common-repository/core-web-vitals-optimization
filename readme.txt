LCP stands for Largest Contentful Paint. LCP measures the time taken by the server to display the largest visible element in the viewport. LCP should be less than 2.5 seconds. If you are seeing the LCP issue: Longer than 4s (Desktop) or (Mobile) error in your Search Console then it means that the server is taking more than 4 seconds to render the largest visible element in the viewport.
